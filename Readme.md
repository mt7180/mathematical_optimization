# Mathematical Optimization 

This is a project to learn about linear (LP) and non-linear (NLP) optimization with python and python based frameworks such as pyomo, linopy and pypsa (power system optimization).

Basic optimization problems:

LP:
- [Optimal Job Scheduling](LP_ex1-post-office.ipynb)
- [Traveling Salesman Problem/ Optimal Route](LP_ex2-Traveling-Salesman.ipynb)
- [Transport Flow Optimization](LP_ex3-Transport-Problem.ipynb)

NLP:
- [Area Optimization](NLP_ex1-L-shaped-house-area.ipynb)



## Power System Optimization
 
Key models for power system optimization are investigated and illustrative examples are modelled with pyomo:

- [Economic Dispatch (ED, DED, DED with ramp rates, DED + battery)](PSO-2_Economic_Dispatch.ipynb)
- [Capacity Expansion](PSO-1_Capacity_Expansion.ipynb)
- [General overview of 17 key optimization models for power system optimization. Depending on the formulation of the cost function and constraints, these can be LP/NLP problems.](PSO-0_Power-System-Optimization_general.md)
