> This project focusses on linear (LP) and non-linear (NLP) programming /optimization of continuous, deterministic problems with python and python based frameworks like pyomo, linopy and pypsa (power system optimization).

## General

Mathematical Optimization is a branch of applied mathematics focused on finding the best possible solution, typically minimizing or maximizing an objective function, subject to a set of constraints. It involves determining the optimal values of decision variables that satisfy conditions 

Optimization problems can be classified as 
- linear or non-linear
- discrete or continuous
- static or dynamic (over time)
- deterministic or stochastic, 

depending on the nature of the objective function and constraints. Techniques like linear programming, dynamic programming, and gradient-based methods are commonly used to solve these problems.

## Power System Optimization
Power system optimization enables system operators to make informed decisions about generation dispatch, load balancing, and network configuration, ultimately leading to a more resilient and cost-effective power system.  

In this repo key models for power system optimization are formulated mathematically and  pyomo/ linopy models are defined.
