    "## Economic Dispatch (ED)\n",
    "\n",
    "System operators must select the most cost effective combination of generators, each with distinct cost structures and engineering limitations. ED is a key operational model for the optimization of the variable (short-run) production costs of a fleet of generators, subject to various technical constraints, to meet the total electricity demand. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Characteristics**:\n",
    "    - Objective: Minimize short-run costs of different producing generators while meeting the total system damand, considering relevant constraints.\n",
    "    - Constraints: Power balance (total generation = total demand), generation limits (minimum and maximum capacity), and sometimes ramp rates for generators.\n",
    "    - Assumptions: Assumes the system can adjust generation output in real-time to minimize cost while meeting demand, without considering transmission constraints.Physics of electricity flows and constraints related to turning on or \"committing\" large thermal generators aswell as network representation are neglected  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advantages**: \n",
    "    - Simple and efficient for real-time dispatch decisions.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**:\n",
    "    - Ignores power system constraints like voltage, line flow, and losses.\n",
    "    - Cannot handle reactive power optimization or voltage stability concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Field of Application**:\n",
    "    - Real-time and short-term dispatch in power markets.\n",
    "    - Used in situations where the main concern is balancing generation and demand economically without consideration of network constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    ">[!NOTE]\n",
    ">- fix costs will not change and would be constant in the objective function -> optimal decision variables would not change by adjusting this constant, therefore, they can safely be ignored for the purposes of finding optimal dispatch, but will have to be considered to calculate producer profits.\n",
