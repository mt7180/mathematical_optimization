# Mathematical Optimization 

Mathematical Optimization is a branch of applied mathematics focused on finding the best possible solution, typically minimizing or maximizing an objective function, subject to a set of constraints. It involves determining the optimal values of decision variables that satisfy conditions 

Optimization problems can be classified as 
- linear or non-linear
- discrete or continuous
- static or dynamic (over time)
- deterministic or stochastic, 

depending on the nature of the objective function and constraints. Techniques like linear programming, dynamic programming, and gradient-based methods are commonly used to solve these problems.

> This project focusses on linear (LP) and non-linear (NLP) programming /optimization on continuous, deterministic problems with python and the pyomo, linopy and pypsa (power system optimization) libraries.
