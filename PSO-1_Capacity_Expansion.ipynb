    "Determine the most cost-effective mix of new thermal generation units for a power system, given projected electricity demand, fuel costs, and environmental constraints. Minimize the total cost of generation, which includes capital investment, operational, and maintenance costs, while satisfying operational constraints (such as generator limits). The \"Greenfield\" approach assumes no existing infrastructure, focusing solely on optimal new capacity decisions.\n",
