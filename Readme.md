# Mathematical Optimization 

This is a project to learn about linear (LP) and non-linear (NLP) optimization with python and python based frameworks such as pyomo and linopy 

Optimization Problems:

LP:
- [Optimal Job Scheduling](LP_ex1-post-office.ipynb)
- [Traveling Salesman Problem/ Optimal Route](LP_ex2-Traveling-Salesman.ipynb)
- [Transport Flow Optimization](LP_ex3-Transport-Problem.ipynb)

NLP:
- [Area Optimization](NLP_ex1-L-shaped-house-area.ipynb)
